disadvantages
------------------------------

- cosistency is a issue 2 nodes does not have same data for the same primary key

- not build for updates

- not read optimized, comparitively slower than rdbms

- relations are not implicit means cant have foriegn keys

- joins are not easy, can only be done using loops to compare data.
